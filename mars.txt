Cold and mostly dry but everything is my favourite colour
The two moons may be problems for the wolfman  
Both moons look like cheese...one appears to be stilton, the other possibly gouda :)
Cheese is a kind of meat, a tasty yellow beef
I milk it from my teets and I try to be discreet
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Cheese
