Cold and mostly dry but everything is my favourite colour
The two moons may be problems for the wolfman  
Both moons look like cheese...one appears to be stilton, the other possibly gouda :)
I like cheese...I think I would like to eat some. Now. Right now.
I think Kirsty likes cheese...she kinda smells like it too!
